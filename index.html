                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This site was created by/for residents of North Magnolia who would be impacted by the proposal to upzone the area by creating a North Magnolia Neighborhood Center as part of the One Seattle Plan. This is a drastic increase in density that is not supported by the unique infrastructure of Magnolia, including geographical factors (peninsula with limited transit) and it puts over 400 residents at risk for displacement by developers.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to organize and work with our government representatives to improve the One Seattle Plan proposal for the North Magnolia Neighborhood Center. In particular we are advocates of  thoughtful, realistic solutions to help increase density that will actually meet objectives of giving residents more access to affordable rental and owner-occupied housing units.  We also encourage the development of anti-displacement plans that are consistent with the July 23, 2023 state law (E2HB1110) mandates. (Link - HB1110)</p>
