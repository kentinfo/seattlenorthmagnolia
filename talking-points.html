                        <h2>Infrastructure Concerns</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Limited Access Points:</strong> Magnolia is a peninsula with only three access points (Magnolia Bridge, Dravus, and Emerson), creating significant traffic bottlenecks that would be exacerbated by increased density.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bridge Vulnerability:</strong> The Magnolia Bridge is aging and vulnerable to seismic events. The city has no funded plan to replace it, yet wants to increase population density.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Inadequate Transit:</strong> North Magnolia has limited bus service with infrequent schedules. The area is not served by light rail and has no plans for improved transit in the near future.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Utility Capacity:</strong> The current water, sewer, and electrical infrastructure was not designed to support the proposed density increase.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="point-card">
                        <h2>Displacement Risks</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Vulnerable Residents:</strong> Over 400 current residents, many in naturally occurring affordable housing, are at risk of displacement by developers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Lack of Protection:</strong> The current plan does not include adequate anti-displacement measures or tenant protections.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Many current residents are on fixed incomes or have moderate incomes and would be unable to afford new housing in the area if displaced.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Community Disruption:</strong> Displacement would break up established community networks and support systems that many residents rely on.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Planning Inconsistencies</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Arbitrary Designation:</strong> The North Magnolia "Neighborhood Center" designation appears arbitrary and does not align with the city's own criteria for such centers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Lack of Amenities:</strong> The area lacks the commercial services, frequent transit, and infrastructure that define true urban villages or neighborhood centers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Inconsistent with Comprehensive Plan:</strong> The proposal contradicts several principles in Seattle's Comprehensive Plan regarding infrastructure capacity and displacement prevention.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Inadequate Analysis:</strong> The environmental impact assessment does not adequately address the unique geographical constraints of Magnolia.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                <strong>Character Change:</strong> The proposed 75-foot height allowance (7+ stories) would dramatically alter the character of a neighborhood that currently consists primarily of 1-3 story buildings.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Green Space Loss:</strong> Increased density without corresponding park and green space additions would reduce per capita access to outdoor spaces.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>School Capacity:</strong> Local schools are already at or near capacity, with no plans for expansion to accommodate population growth.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Emergency Services:</strong> Response times for emergency services could be negatively impacted by increased traffic congestion and limited access points.
