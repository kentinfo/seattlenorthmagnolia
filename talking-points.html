                        <h2>Infrastructure Concerns</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bridge Vulnerability:</strong> The Magnolia Bridge is aging and vulnerable to seismic events. Seattle Department of Transportation has placed weight restrictions on the bridge that prohibit commercial truck use and studied replacement but no funds have yet been authorized for replacing the bridge. Funding does not appear to be available given existing City budget deficits and likely future revenue shortfalls.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Inadequate Transit:</strong> North Magnolia does not have a major transit stop (light rail, commuter rail, or RapidRide transit) and no plans for a light rail extension to Magnolia. The nearest D-Line RapidRide transit station at 15th Ave NW and W Emerson is over a mile away from the proposed North Magnolia Neighborhood Center.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Utility Capacity:</strong> It is unclear whether existing public facilities (water, sewer, storm water, and electrical infrastructure) are capable of supporting proposed density increases. Much of north Magnolia is served by a combined sewer overflow and additional impervious surfaces from proposed development is likely to contribute to more overflow events and degradation of receiving waters (Puget Sound).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Parking:</strong> The proposed density without more reasonable offstreet parking is likely to result in increased traffic delays and parking availability problems for businesses. While more people may be making a transition to having no car and relying on public transportation, most people still and will continue to rely on their personal vehicle for getting around for convenience.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Displacement Risks</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Background:</strong>
                                <p>
                                    A stated objective of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the comprehensive plan update that resulted in the One Seattle Plan (OSP) is to “reduce residential displacement and support existing residents, particularly low-income households, who are struggling to stay in their neighborhoods.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is unclear what methods were used to evaluate potential economic displacement of single-family residents in the North Magnolia Neighborhood Center from proposed increases in densities that are likely to result in substantial increases in property taxes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the FEIS Major Policy Updates section (page 1-20), changes to the comprehensive plan could include “identifying strategies for addressing displacement.” However, no strategies are provided—rather, they are expected to be developed in the future after adoption of the OSP. Strategies for avoiding physical and economic displacement should be included in the OSP before it is adopted.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    In the FEIS Section “How did we analyze Population, Housing, & Employment? (beginning on p 1-72)” there is brief mention of general types of data used to evaluate areas more at risk of displacement as well as a statement that reiterates a primary focus of this analysis is to identify how effectively each FEIS alternative achieves three objectives:
                                </p>
                                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 1.5em;">
                                    <li>Increase the supply, diversity, and affordability of market-rate housing.</li>
                                    <li>Increase the supply of income-restricted housing.</li>
                                    <li><em>Reduce residential displacement (emphasis added).</em></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The Preferred Alternative (also called the OSP) would create the most net new housing units by housing type (FEIS Exhibit 1.6-14). The OSP would result in the most units that could be owner-occupied (FEIS, p. 1-74), which doesn’t appear to translate to more affordable housing as needed and required by state law.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Creation of more affordable housing, which is likely to result in greater rental and owner-occupied units, appears predicated on two existing programs, Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) and Multifamily Tax Exemption (MFTE). Rather than build more affordable units, the OSP and other alternatives appear to rely heavily on developer payments to the Mandatory Housing Affordability program and does not apply MHA requirements in Neighborhood Residential Zones (FEIS Exhibits 1.6-15 and 1.6-16, pp 1-75).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The MFTE is a tax exemption incentive for developers to provide a portion of units in multifamily housing proposals for income-and rent-restricted affordable housing for 12 years after which the owner can renew the tax exemption or rent those units at market rate. The OSP would result in an estimated net gain of 865 affordable housing units through MFTE, a modest increase compared to existing trends in use of the program (FEIS Exhibit 1.6-17, pp 1-76). It is unclear how or whether so few affordable units would meet existing demand or future needs but the number seems quite small.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Vulnerable Residents:</strong>
                                <p>
                                    There are over 400 lots zoned NR. An unknown number of these would be vulnerable to displacement and likely not be able to find affordable housing once displaced.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Lack of Protection:</strong>
                                <p>
                                    The OSP (preferred/selected alternative) provides an inadequate analysis of displacement risks to existing owners of NR lots. It is suggested that displacement risk is low for 2002 residents within neighborhood centers in Area 3, according to the FEIS (Exhibit 2.4-21 p. 2-42). With over 400 NR lots in the North Magnolia Neighborhood Center alone, it is unclear how this number was derived or is accurate. It seems likely that at least some of the current single-family residents on NR-zoned lots would be at high risk of displacement. This level of displacement risk does not meet the intent of state law.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <strong>Economic Impact:</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Residents with fixed or moderate incomes at risk of displacement would likely be unable to afford new housing in the area and would likely face economic hardship.
                                </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Neighborhood Center Designation:</strong> The North Magnolia "Neighborhood Center" designation was added very late in the Environmental Impact Statement review process and does not appear to meet at least some of the criteria for the neighborhood center designation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Lack of Amenities:</strong> The North Magnolia Neighborhood Center lacks a major transit stop and some of the commercial and culturally relevant businesses and services, such as a bank, drug store, restaurants, arts, and cultural anchors typical of other neighborhood centers like the Magnolia Village Neighborhood Center.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Inconsistent with other neighborhood center designations:</strong> It is not near a major transit stop, transportation infrastructure access and egress is poorly suited to likely increased traffic; the North Magnolia Neighborhood Center will not provide affordable housing units to rent or own for very low income, low income or even most middle income households.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Inadequate Analysis:</strong> The environmental impact assessment does not appear to consider and evaluate existing infrastructure limitations, critical services (police and fire), school capacity, and cumulative effects of the proposed Ft. Lawton Redevelopment Plan in concert with increased demand and constraints placed upon these by proposed OSP densities. Existing transit services and the three bridges and existing streets are inadequate to handle increased traffic. City Light, a major source of revenue, expects another low hydropower generation year in 2025 from below normal snowpack and future climate change predictions forecast more of the same, raising questions about the accuracy of revenue projections incorporated into the FEIS. Furthermore, the existing level of transit service is unlikely to be sufficient to handle future demand and assumptions on parking needs and automobile use do not appear to be supported by existing data.

                                <strong>Character Change:</strong> The extensive increased densities and allowable building heights (from NR to LR3 and NC1-40 to NC2-55 and NC2-65) would dramatically alter the character of a neighborhood that currently consists primarily of 1-3 story buildings.
